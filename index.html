            <p >Hello, welcome to my online Curriculum.
                This is a small website I’ve elaborated to showcase a bit of my education, experience and my web development skills.
                <br><br>
                
                My name is Manuel. Currently I’m working at Hostinger as a Customer Success Specialist since August 2022. 
                <br><br>
                Since Hostinger is a web hosting company that provides hosting services, emails and domains it eventually piqued my interest to try my hand at web development and learn. Currently I’m studying Full stack at Coder House.
                <br><br>
                To be brief I am someone who has been focused on customer service for quite a while in my overall jobs opportunities, I’m focused, empathetic and am able to communicate well with users to help them solve the issues they might have by either guiding them or escalating and communicating with internal teams should some issues require direct intervention.
                <br><br>
                Aside from these skills with customers, I have also learned about hosting, websites, email, domains and how they work. I’ve learned to solve issues regarding websites and how to effectively troubleshoot issues. 
                <br><br>
                Of course I have to mention that I have sales experience as well in a previous job where I used to make cold calls to sell gym memberships and generate leads for credit score companies.
                <br><br>
                And to close this presentation I have also experienced being a leader in Hostinger as a Shift leader on weekends. This means I kept track of the agents entering on time, checking if someone was missing, effectively managing the team and strategizing ways on how to tackle the queue and deliver a timely response to our customers. As a shift leader I also helped solve any doubts other agents may have and of course to make a daily report with any issues that might have arised that day, common issues or patterns in chats and provide feedback about agents and the day.
