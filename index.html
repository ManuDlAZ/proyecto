            <p>Hello, welcome to my online Curriculum.
                This is a small website I’ve elaborated to showcase a bit of my education, experience and my web
                development skills.
                <br><br>

                My name is Manuel. Currently I’m working at Hostinger as a Customer Success Specialist since August
                2022.
                <br><br>
                Since Hostinger is a web hosting company that provides hosting services, emails and domains it
                eventually piqued my interest to try my hand at web development and learn. Currently I’m studying Full
                stack at Coder House.
                <br><br>
                To be brief I am someone who has been focused on customer service for quite a while in my overall jobs
                opportunities, I’m focused, empathetic and am able to communicate well with users to help them solve the
                issues they might have by either guiding them or escalating and communicating with internal teams should
                some issues require direct intervention.
                <br><br>
                Aside from these skills with customers, I have also learned about hosting, websites, email, domains and
                how they work. I’ve learned to solve issues regarding websites and how to effectively troubleshoot
                issues.
                <br><br>
                Of course I have to mention that I have sales experience as well in a previous job where I used to make
                cold calls to sell gym memberships and generate leads for credit score companies.
                <br><br>
                And to close this presentation I have also experienced being a leader in Hostinger as a Shift leader on
                weekends. This means I kept track of the agents entering on time, checking if someone was missing,
                effectively managing the team and strategizing ways on how to tackle the queue and deliver a timely
                response to our customers. As a shift leader I also helped solve any doubts other agents may have and of
                course to make a daily report with any issues that might have arised that day, common issues or patterns
                in chats and provide feedback about agents and the day.
            </p>
